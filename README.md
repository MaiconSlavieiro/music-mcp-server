# Music MCP Server

A self-hosted MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI assistants control Spotify playback, manage playlists, and fetch lyrics and song metadata from Genius — with a built-in web setup wizard.

Works with Kiro, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Quick Start

### With Docker (recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your credentials
echo '{}' > config.json
docker compose up -d
```

### Without Docker

```bash
npm install
npm run build
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env
npm start
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once running, open the setup wizard at `http://127.0.0.1:18960/setup`.

## Setup Wizard

The server includes a web wizard that walks you through configuration step by step:

1. **Welcome** — Set the server Base URL (used for OAuth callbacks and MCP endpoint)
2. **Spotify** — Client ID/Secret + OAuth authentication
3. **Genius** — API Access Token
4. **Security** — MCP Bearer token and web interface credentials
5. **Summary** — Tests all integrations and shows the MCP config to copy

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | Server port | `18960` |
| `BASE_URL` | Public server URL | `http://127.0.0.1:18960` |
| `WEB_USERNAME` | Basic Auth user for the wizard | — |
| `WEB_PASSWORD` | Basic Auth password for the wizard | — |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Bearer token for the MCP endpoint | — |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Spotify Client ID | — |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Spotify Client Secret | — |
| `GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Genius Access Token | — |

Environment variables serve as initial bootstrap. Once configured via the wizard, values are persisted in `config.json` and take priority.

### config.json

Local persistence file for tokens, credentials, and application state. Created automatically. Do not commit (already in `.gitignore`).

## Connecting to an MCP Client

Add to your `mcp.json` (Kiro, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "music": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:18960/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The wizard generates this config automatically on the Summary page.

## Getting Credentials

### Spotify

1. Go to [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create an app
3. Add the Redirect URI: `{BASE_URL}/spotify/callback`
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

> **Important:** Spotify does not allow `localhost` as a Redirect URI. The current rules are:
> - HTTPS is required, except for loopback addresses
> - For local development, use the explicit IP: `http://127.0.0.1:18960/spotify/callback` or `http://[::1]:18960/spotify/callback`
> - `localhost` is not permitted
>
> For HTTPS access (required in production), see the options below.

#### Exposing the Server

If you need HTTPS (production, or a fixed public URL), here are some options:

- **Cloudflare Tunnel** — secure tunnel, no open ports needed. [Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)
- **ngrok** — quick temporary HTTPS URLs. [Docs](https://ngrok.com/docs/)
- **Reverse proxy** (Caddy, Nginx, Traefik) — for self-hosted production setups with your own domain and SSL certificates.

### Genius

1. Go to [genius.com/api-clients](https://genius.com/api-clients)
2. Create a new API Client:
   - **App Name:** Music MCP Server
   - **Icon URL:** `{BASE_URL}/icon.svg`
   - **App Website URL:** `{BASE_URL}`
   - **Redirect URI:** `http://localhost`
3. Click "Generate Access Token" and copy it
